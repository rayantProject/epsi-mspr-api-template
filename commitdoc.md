# How to Write Good Commit Messages

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for writing commit messages. This convention helps to maintain a consistent and readable git history, making it easier to understand the changes made in each commit.

## Commit Message Structure

A commit message consists of three distinct parts, separated by a blank line:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

1. **Type**: The type indicates the kind of change that the commit introduces. It must be one of the following:

    - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    - `chore`: Miscellaneous tasks that do not modify the source code or tests
    - `ci`: Changes related to continuous integration and deployment scripts
    - `docs`: Documentation-only changes
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `revert`: A commit that reverts a previous commit
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
    - `test`: Adding or modifying tests

2. **Scope** (optional): The scope specifies the part of the codebase that the commit relates to. It helps provide additional context about the changes.

3. **Short Summary**: A brief summary of the changes made in the commit. It should be written in the present tense and use an imperative tone (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

4. **Body** (optional): A more detailed description of the commit. It should explain the motivation behind the changes, any important considerations, and any relevant information that helps understand the context.

5. **Footer** (optional): Additional metadata or reference information, such as issue or ticket numbers, related pull requests, or keywords.

## Examples

Here are some examples of well-formed commit messages:

```
feat: Add support for user authentication

This commit introduces a new authentication system for the application. Users can now register, log in, and access protected routes. The authentication logic is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and the bcrypt library for password hashing.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): Resolve issue with GET /users endpoint

The GET /users endpoint was returning an incorrect response due to a typo in the database query. This commit fixes the issue and adds a new unit test to prevent regressions.
```

```
chore: Update dependencies to latest versions

Update all project dependencies to their latest compatible versions, including React (16.13.1 -> 17.0.2), Express (4.17.1 -> 4.18.2), and Mongoose (5.11.20 -> 6.0.5).
```

By following these conventions, your commit messages will be clear, concise, and informative, making it easier for your team to navigate the project's git history and understand the changes made over time.
